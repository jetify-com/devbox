This is a Devbox for running the [Pictionary](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/pictionary/tree/main) demo by [@aliabd](https://github.com/aliabd) that can be found on Hugging Face Spaces. 

Note: This demo currently only works on WSL3 with Nvidia GPUs. For Linux, additional packages and configuration may be needed.
