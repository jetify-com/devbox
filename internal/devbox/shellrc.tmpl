IF YOU EDIT THIS FILE, REMEMBER TO MAKE EQUIVALENT CHANGES TO shellrc_fish.tmpl

This template defines the shellrc file that the devbox shell will run at
startup.

It includes the user's original shellrc, which varies depending on their shell.
It will either be ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, a path set in ENV, or something else. It
also appends any user-defined shell hooks from devbox.json.

Devbox needs to ensure that the shell's PATH, prompt, and a few other things are
set correctly after the user's shellrc runs. The commands to do this are in
the "Devbox Post-init Hook" section.

This file is useful for debugging shell errors, so try to keep the generated
content readable.
