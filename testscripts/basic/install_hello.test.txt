# Devbox should be able to install a very simple package like 'hello'
# and it should work.

# Ensure hello is not found anywhere in the environment
! exec hello
! exec devbox run hello

# Initialize devbox
exec devbox init

# Add the package and run hello with devbox
exec devbox add hello
! exec hello

# Run hello and check it prints the right output
exec devbox run hello
stdout 'Hello, world!'

# Once we have better progress output, we should check that stderr is empty, with:
# ! stderr .+  # No stderr output
# As is, we always print 'Ensuring packages are installed'.
