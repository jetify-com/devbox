# Test that the environment is setup correctly by our testing framework.

# PATH should have a single entry: the one setup by the testing framework
env.path.len 1

# Through that path we should be able to execute devbox:
exec devbox version

# But nothing else (including common tools):
! exec grep --version
! exec echo "echo should not be in path"
