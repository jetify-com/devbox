Developers who want to use Jetify for their personal projects can sign up for a free account. The free account comes with basic Jetify Cloud features (like Secrets), with additional features like Deployments and Cache available for purchase.

If you want to collaborate and share your projects with other members on your team, you will need to upgrade to a **Team Account**. Team accounts let you invite other developers to share resources and collaborate on projects in Jetify Cloud.

Users with a free account can upgrade to a paid team on the dashboard anytime.

## Creating a New Team Account

1. From the Team Selector in the top right of your dashboard, select **Create a New Team**

1. Your new team will be created, and you will be automatically switched to your new team. You can now [invite other members](./inviting_members.md) to join your team.

## Billing

Free accounts are free forever. You will need to add a payment method to unlock paid tier features.

Team accounts are billed monthly based on the number of active members in your team. You can view your current billing status and update your billing information from the **Billing** tab in the Jetify Dashboard.
