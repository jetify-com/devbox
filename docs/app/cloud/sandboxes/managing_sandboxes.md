Devboxes that you've previously created can be managed from the Jetify Cloudboxes dashboard. From the dashboard, you can start, stop, and delete your previous Cloudboxes.

## Accessing the Cloudboxes Dashboard

To access the Cloudboxes dashboard, navigate to [cloud.jetify.com](https://cloud.jetify.com) and log in with your Jetify account. Once you select an Org, you will can view all the cloudboxes that you have created within that org on the org page.

If you've created any projects in the org, you can also navigate to the project and select the Sandboxes tab to view all the Cloudboxes that you have created for that project.

## Stopping and Starting Cloudboxes

Cloudboxes are automatically stopped after 15 minutes of user inactivity. This is to help you save resources, and avoid being billed for unused Cloudboxes.

If you want to manually stop your Cloudbox, click on the `Options` button on the Cloudbox that you want to stop, and then click on the `Stop` button. Your Cloudboxes package store and project data will be saved, so you can quickly resume your work when you restart the Cloudbox.

:::info
Stopped Cloudboxes are not billed for CPU usage, but you may be billed for storage usage in excess of the free tier.

To restart your Cloudbox, click the option button on the cloud box you want to start, and then click the "Start" button. This will launch the Cloudbox with your previous state and packages.

## Deleting Cloudboxes

By default, Cloudboxes are deleted if they are not used for 14 consecutive days. This is to help you save storage costs, and avoid being billed for unused Cloudbox disks.

If you are done with a Cloudbox, you can delete it by clicking on the `Options` button on the Cloudbox that you want to delete, and then clicking on the `Delete` button. This will permanently delete the Cloudbox and the data associated with it.
