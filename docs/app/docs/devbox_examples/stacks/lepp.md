## How to Run

### Initializing

In this directory, run:

`devbox shell`

This will run `initdb` automatically on initialization. To start the Servers + Postgres service, run:

`devbox services up`

### Creating the DB

You can run the creation script using `devbox run create_db`. This will create a Postgres DB based on `setup_postgres_db.sql`.

### Testing the Example

You can query Nginx on port 80, which will route to the PHP example.

## How to Recreate this Example

1. Create a new project with `devbox init`
1. Add the packages using the command below. Installing the packages with `devbox add` will ensure that the plugins are activated:

```bash
devbox add postgresql@14 php@8.1 php81Extensions.pgsql@latest nginx@1.24
```

1. Update `devbox.d/nginx/httpd.conf` to point to the directory with your PHP files. You'll need to update the `root` directive to point to your project folder
2. Follow the instructions above in the How to Run section to initialize your project.

Note that the `.sock` filepath can only be maximum 100 characters long. You can point to a different path by setting the `PGHOST` env variable in your `devbox.json` as follows:

```json
"env": {
    "PGHOST": "/<some-shorter-path>"
}
```
