## Stating a Sandbox from Your Dashboard

## Starting a Sandbox with a Github URL

You can start a Sandbox from any Github Repo by prepending the repo URL with:

```bash
https://cloud.jetify.com/new/
```

## Starting a Sandbox from a Template

You can also start a Sandbox from a template project by navigating to the [Jetify Dashboard](https://cloud.jetify.com/dashboard) and clicking on the `New Sandbox` button.

A full list of available templates and projects can be found in the [Devbox Examples](../../../devbox_examples/) page of our documentation.
