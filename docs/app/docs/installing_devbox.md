## Prerequisities

Devbox requires `nix` to be installed.

- Install [Nix Package Manager](https://nixos.org/download.html). (Don't worry, you don't need to learn Nix.)

Optionally, if you would like to build a container image, you will need Docker.

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). 

## Install Devbox

Use the following install script to get the latest version of Devbox:

```bash
