# devbox services up

Starts process-compose and runs all the services in your project. If a list of services is specified in the arguments, only those services will be started.

```bash
devbox services up [services]... [flags]
```

This command will launch the process-compose TUI in the foreground. To run process-compose and your services in the background, use the `-b` flag.

Once your services are running, you can manage them using `services start`, `services stop`, and `services restart`.

## Examples
```bash
# Start all services with process compose in the foreground
devbox services up

#Start all services with process compose in the background
devbox services up -b

# Start only the web service with process compose in the foreground
devbox services up web
```
