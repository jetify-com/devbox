Projects deployed with Jetify Cloud are automatically configured to use [Jetify Secrets](../secrets/index.md) when deploying your project. You do not need to authenticate, or add any additional configuration to use your secrets. Your project will deploy using the `prod` environment for your secrets by default. 

For more details on how to configure secrets, see: 

* [Jetify Secrets Overview](../secrets/index.md)
* [Setting Secrets from the CLI](../secrets/secrets_cli.md)
* [Setting Secrets from the Dashboard](../secrets/dashboard_secrets.md)
