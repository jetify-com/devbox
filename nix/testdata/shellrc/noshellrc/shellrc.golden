# We need to do some processing on the PATH to ensure that any NIX_STORE paths
# stay at the front.
#
# Use IFS to split the PATH by ':' and then loop over each directory. Do the
# splitting in a subshell so that the change to IFS is temporary.
#
# The first case pattern matches a path that has the Nix store as a prefix, in
# which case we append it to nix_path. The second case pattern matches
# everything else and appends to non_nix_path. At the end, we join them with
# nix_path at the front.
#
# Some notes:
# 	- We do `for ... in $(echo $PATH)` instead of `for ... in $PATH` because
# 	  zsh doesn't do word splitting on unquoted variables.
# 	- The syntax `${nix_path:+$nix_path:}` means, "if nix_path is already
# 	  set, write `$nix_path:` (with the colon) instead." This ensures we
# 	  don't start with a colon on the first append.
# 	- You can't have comments in a subshell, hence this one long comment at
# 	  the top.
# 	- Keep this as POSIX as possible to maximize compatibility with
# 	  different shells.
