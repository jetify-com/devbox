{{- /*

This template defines the shellrc file that the devbox shell will run at
startup.

It includes the user's original shellrc, which varies depending on their shell.
It will either be ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, a path set in ENV, or something else. It
also appends any user-defined shell hooks from devbox.json.

Devbox needs to ensure that the shell's PATH, prompt, and a few other things are
set correctly after the user's shellrc runs. The commands to do this are in
the "Devbox Post-init Hook" section.

This file is useful for debugging shell errors, so try to keep the generated
content readable.
